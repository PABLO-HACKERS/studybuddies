## Studybuddies 🐾

StudyBuddies is a gamified quiz app powered by AI that rewards you for answering questions correctly. Simply choose your class, enter what you would like to be quizzed on, and choose your difficulty. The AI will generate an appropriate quiz and you will be rewarded with coins for each correct answer. Spend these coins to purchase new buddies!

## How we built it 💻

This was our team's very first hackathon and we are proud that we managed to develop our idea into a functional app in under 8 hours. Despite no experience in mobile development, we decided to build our whole project with react native. We also leveraged the openai api to send requests to chat-gpt and generate multiple choice style questions.

## What's next 📈

We love the idea behind studdybuddies and hope to scale it up in the future. Along with many more small features, like more pets, we would primarily like to implement the scanning of class material to create more personalized assessments.
